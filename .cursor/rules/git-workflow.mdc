# Git Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: Never automatically commit or push changes unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Rules

1. **Only commit when asked**: Do not create git commits unless the user specifically says:
   - "commit"
   - "git commit"
   - "commit this"
   - "save these changes"
   
2. **Only push when asked**: Do not push to remote unless the user specifically says:
   - "push"
   - "git push"
   - "deploy"
   - "push to production"

3. **Always ask first**: If it's unclear whether the user wants to commit/push, ask them explicitly.

## Examples

```bash
# ❌ BAD - Auto-committing without being asked
# User: "fix the button styling"
# AI: [fixes code, then commits and pushes]

# ✅ GOOD - Only commit when explicitly requested
# User: "fix the button styling"
# AI: [fixes code, stops]

# User: "commit and push this"
# AI: [commits with descriptive message, then pushes]
```

## Exception

The only exception is when the user says something like "check lint then deploy" or "lint and push" - these clearly indicate they want the changes committed and pushed after linting passes.
