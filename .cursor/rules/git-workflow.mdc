# Git Workflow Rules

## Do NOT Auto-Push

**IMPORTANT**: Never automatically push changes to git unless the user explicitly tells you to "deploy" or "push".

### Allowed Actions Without Permission
- Make code changes
- Run tests
- Check TypeScript/linting
- Stage changes with `git add`
- Create commits

### Require Explicit Permission
- `git push` - Only when user says "deploy", "push", or "push to vercel"
- Force push operations
- Any destructive git operations

### Workflow Pattern

1. Make changes as requested
2. Run checks (tsc, lint) if needed
3. Stage and commit changes
4. **STOP** - Wait for user to explicitly request deployment
5. Only push when user says: "deploy", "push", "push it", "send it", etc.

## Example

```bash
# ✅ GOOD - Stop after commit
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix bug"
# Wait for user instruction

# ❌ BAD - Don't auto-push
git add -A && git commit -m "Fix bug" && git push
```

When changes are ready but not pushed, tell the user:
> "Changes committed locally. Let me know when you want me to push/deploy."
